## Abstract
### **Problem/Goal**
Our project aims to develop a reinforcement learning agent to defeat specific bosses in soul-like games. Soul-like games are focused on skill combinations and choices, precise execution, and sharp judgment. Training an agent to beat the last boss, "Lace of the Abyss," is our aim.
### **Method**
We plan to implement a Deep Q-Network(DQN) architecture to train our agent through trial-and-error gameplay. The agent will learn through repeated gameplay to know the game status, operations, boss health, and boss skills. Our training environment will include two mods, OCR to catch the boss's health, and revive instantly to speed up training.
### **Challenge**
Recently, the long-awaited Hollow Knight: Silksong was finally released. This recently released game was chosen as the foundation for our Souls-like AI training. Using a newly published game means we are dealing with brand new stuff, with no current AI solutions or proven techniques to draw on, making the project more demanding and worthwhile. 
### **Application**
